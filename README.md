## My process

I began with html and css and used previous css classes to speed up the process and tried to experiment with different ideas

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about how to use the width property to make responsive designs that can move with the screen size. I did this by making the container for links a percentage of the container of the card.
